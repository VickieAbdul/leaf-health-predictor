# Leaf Health Predictor
I created this Leaf Health Predictor App to help users assess the health of plants based on features such as leaf color, size, and the presence of spots. 
It was built using a Decision Tree classifier to provide a basic prediction of a plantâ€™s health status: Healthy, Needs Water, or Diseased. 
This serves as an introduction to building interactive machine learning applications with Streamlit.

# Relevance to Agriculture and Horticulture
The app, though simple, still reflects a real-world problem in the agriculture and horticulture sectors, where monitoring plant health is critical for crop yield and management. 
By automating the process of assessing plant health, more advanced versions of this app could be used by farmers, gardeners, and horticulturists to identify early signs of disease or water stress, ultimately improving productivity and sustainability.

# My Perspective
The app is intended as a beginner-level project, allowing me to get familiar with Streamlit and learn how to deploy machine learning models in a user-friendly interface. 
The project is focused on a practical, real-world use case, making it easy to see the connection between machine learning and its applications in various industries.
