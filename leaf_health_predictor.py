    This **Leaf Health Predictor** will help users assess the health of plants based on features such as leaf color, size, and the presence of spots. 
    It was built using a Decision Tree classifier to provide a basic prediction of a plantâ€™s health status: Healthy, Needs Water, or Diseased.
    This project provides a foundational understanding of deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios.

    **Explanation of features**:
    
    Leaf color Values:
    - **Green (0)**: Healthy or well-nourished leaves.
    - **Yellow (1)**: Possible nutrient deficiency or stress.
    - **Brown (2)**: Indication of disease, dehydration, or aging.
    
    Leaf length and width:
    - represents leaf measurements in cm
    - they could be very small or underdeveloped leaves or fully developed or large leaves.
    
    Leaf Health Values:
    - **Yes (1)**: The leaf has spots, indicating possible disease or pest damage.
    - **No (0)**: The leaf is free of spots, suggesting that it is healthy or not affected by visible diseases.
